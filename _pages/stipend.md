Transparency in Graduate Student Funding
======

I believe transparency and openness in salary (and stipend) is important for equitable and fair remuneration. To that end I'm using this platform to make public what I'm paid.
My hope is that we can make talking about money less taboo and benefit from knowing what our peers are paid, and thus what we can expect for the same work. 

Current yearly stipend from the Brown University Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department: $34,180.00 

This is up from the $31,380.00 of the previous year, the raise given to students in biomedical fields to bring their stipends up in line with the other departments.
