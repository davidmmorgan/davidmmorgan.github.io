As of 2018 I'm a graduate student at Brown University in the [Weinreich Lab](https://www.brown.edu/research/labs/weinreich/) where I research molecular evolution and epistasis. Right now I'm doing that using beta-lactamases and deep mutational scanning. 

My committee: [Dan Weinreich](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/dweinrei), [David Rand](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/drand), [Brandon Ogbunu](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/cogbunug), [Peter Belenky](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/pbelenky), and [Lorin Crawford](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/lcrawfo1)

I'm interested in molecular evolution, epistasis, promiscuity, novelty, astrobiology, and the search for excellent tiramisu.


Previously I was at Massachusetts General Hospital in the Gastrointestinal Unit working on links between the gut microbiome and irritable bowel disease.

I attended Worcester Polytechnic Institute for my B.S., where I had the pleasure of working in the [Shell Lab](https://labs.wpi.edu/shelllab/) on the [regulation of heat-shock proteins in mycobacteria](https://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/mqp-all/1610/). 


When I'm not in the lab I enjoy backpacking, reading science fiction and fantasy, brewing beer, and spending time with my dog Gigi.
