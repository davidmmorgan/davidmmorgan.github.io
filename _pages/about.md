I'm a graduate student at Brown University in the [Weinreich Lab](https://www.brown.edu/research/labs/weinreich/) where I study molecular evolution and epistasis. Right now I'm doing that using beta-lactamases and deep mutational scanning as part of the [Genotypes to Phenotypes group](https://ddg2phenome.org/).


My interests include: molecular evolution, epistasis, promiscuity, robustness, novelty, experimental evolution, astrobiology, and the search for excellent tiramisu.


My committee: [Dan Weinreich](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/dweinrei), [David Rand](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/drand), [Brandon Ogbunu](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/cogbunug), [Peter Belenky](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/pbelenky), and [Lorin Crawford](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/lcrawfo1)


When I'm not in the lab I enjoy backpacking, reading science fiction and fantasy, brewing beer, and spending time with my dog Gigi.

Previously I was at Massachusetts General Hospital in the Gastrointestinal Unit working on links between the gut microbiome and irritable bowel disease. I presented that research in Washington D.C. at the 2018 Digestive Disease Week conference.

I attended Worcester Polytechnic Institute for my B.S., where I had the pleasure of working in the [Shell Lab](https://labs.wpi.edu/shelllab/) on the [regulation of heat-shock proteins in mycobacteria](https://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/mqp-all/1610/). 

I was a part of [WPI's 2015 iGEM team](http://2015.igem.org/Team:WPI-Worcester) where we investigated the biofilm-affecting properties of antifreeze proteins.
