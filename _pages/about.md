As of 2018 I'm a graduate student at Brown University in the [Weinreich Lab](https://www.brown.edu/research/labs/weinreich/) where I research molecular evolution and epistasis. Right now I'm do that using beta-lactamases and deep mutational scanning. 

Previously I was at Massachusetts General Hospital in the Gastrointestinal Unit working on the iterface between the gut microbiome and irritable bowel disease.

I attended Worcester Polytechnic Institute for my B.S. where I had the pleasure of working in the [Shell Lab](https://labs.wpi.edu/shelllab/) on the [regulation of heat-shock proteins in mycobacteria](https://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/mqp-all/1610/). 

When I'm not in the lab I enjoy backpacking, reading (science fiction and fantasy), brewing beer, and spending time with my dog Gigi.
