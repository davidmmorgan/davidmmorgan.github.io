Research experience
======
* Graduate Student, Weinreich Lab, Brown University, Providence, RI, August 2018 - Present
  * Using deep mutational scanning to investigate fitness landscapes and epistatic interactions
* Research Technitian, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, May 2017 - June 2018
  * Research Technician and Clinical Coordinator for the Khalili and Garber labs in the Gastrointestinal
Unit.
  * Conducting research focused on the human gut microbiome and the disease Microscopic Colitis.
  * Recruiting patients into research studies, involving contacting potential subjects, explaining the
nature of the study, and drawing blood samples for some studies.
  * Processing research samples for human gut microbiome analysis, from sample collection to nucleic
acid extraction.
  * Performing bioinformatic analysis of metagenome shotgun sequencing to analyze gut microbiome
composition.
* Student Volunteer, Shell Lab, WPI, Worcester, MA, January 2015 - January 2017
  * Conducted independent research under the direction of the principle investigator.
  * Investigated the role of the 5’UTR in expression of groES in M. smegmotis, an M. tuberculosis analog.
  * Utilized recombinant DNA technology, fluorescent reporters, and quantitative PCR to create
mycobacterial strains and measure differences between them.
  * Analyzed data from fluorescence microscopy images using ImageJ and from flow cytometry using
FlowJo.
* Student Volunteer, Gegear Lab, WPI, Worcester, MA, August - December 2016
  * Investigated the potential for a transcriptomic profile in B. impatiens of the response to neonicitenoid
pesticides.
  * Gathered wild specimens at multiple field sites for transcriptomic profile testing.
  * Correlated field data with experimental data gathered through exposure of specimens to known
quantities and types of pesticides.
* Process Development-Analytics Intern, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Devens, MA, une - August 2016
  * Conducted research on Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) Ultra-Performance Liquid
Chromatography (UPLC) columns to evaluate their potential for analysis of upstream drug production.
  * Compared columns across multiple manufacturers using a wide array of metrics.
  * Made recommendations to the PDA department that influenced company-wide policy.
  * Results were presented by a senior coworker at the annual meeting of the company PDA
departments.
* International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) team member, Worcester, MA, June - September 2015
  * Worked as part of a student team conducting novel research in synthetic biology.
  * Investigated antifreeze proteins and their potential use as antibacterial agents due to their biofilm
inhibiting properties.
  * Cloned diverse antifreeze genes into E. coli to determine their effect on cold tolerance and biofilm
formation.
  * Presented research at an international conference, the iGEM Giant Jamboree, of peers and leaders in
synthetic biology and was awarded a gold medal for our research, presentation, and related materials
by the conference organizers.
  * Granted a provisional patent with transition to full patent in progress.
